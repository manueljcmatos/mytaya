## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Football predictions first (API-Football proven from betpro), basketball and boxing later
- [Roadmap]: Prediction cards isolated in Phase 6 due to Satori/Workers technical risk
- [Roadmap]: PBA, NCAA PH, and boxing grouped as manual content workflows in final phase
- [01-01]: Deep teal (#0F766E) brand palette -- Philippine tropical identity, distinct from betpro's gold
- [01-01]: Bebas Neue (display) + Inter (body) typography -- distinct from betpro's Oswald/Outfit
- [01-01]: Denormalized sport column on predictions table for query performance
- [01-01]: Conditional Supabase client (null if env vars missing) -- no hardcoded fallback keys
- [01-02]: Wordmark 'MY' in brand primary + 'TAYA' in theme text using Bebas Neue display font
- [01-02]: x-default hreflang points to Filipino (tl) URL as the default locale
- [01-02]: LanguageSwitcher shows alternate language flag (what user switches TO)
- [01-02]: View transition support via astro:after-swap event listeners

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6: Satori on Workers has 6+ documented failure modes -- needs PoC before committing to card templates
- Phase 7: PBA API data quality unverified -- must audit API-Basketball PBA endpoints before building pipeline
- Phase 2: PAGCOR operator licensing status must be verified at implementation time (regulations evolving)
